								<h2><a href="">Scientific Stay in Madeira</a></h2>  
								<br />
											<p> From January 13th to 17th, I had the pleasure of conducting a research stay in Madeira (Portugal). This stay provided an incredible opportunity to advance one of my current research projects, which focuses on a fascinating marine species.
												I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Pedro Neves for his invaluable support in acquiring the specimens needed for this study. I am also deeply thankful to Dr. Manuel Biscoito for granting me access to the laboratory at the Marine Station of Funchal, which served as an excellent facility for my research activities.
												Madeira’s unique marine environment continues to inspire my work, and I look forward to sharing more about this project as it unfolds.

								<br />
											<p> I’m excited to announce the publication of the article, "Twenty Years of AFORO: New Developments and Connections Enhancing Otolith Research", in Fisheries Research on December 6, 2024.
												The paper highlights the advancements in AFORO (Anàlisi de FORmes d’Otòlits) over the past two decades. Key developments include improvements in otolith shape classification using Wavelet transforms, 3D otolith descriptions, and geographic filters. These enhancements allow for more accurate predator-prey studies and classification of otoliths. Additionally, the introduction of Deep Learning algorithms promises to advance classification further.

								<h2><a>Collaborating Across Borders: Research in Doha, Qatar</a></h2>  
								<br />
											<p> Since October 30, I have been working in Doha, Qatar, as part of an Erasmus+ fellowship, collaborating with Dr. Pedro Range from Qatar University. This opportunity has allowed me to engage in exciting research while exchanging ideas with an international team.
												Despite the challenges of being far from home, I’ve embraced the experience wholeheartedly, dedicating time to our project even on weekends from my hotel. This fellowship not only underscores the importance of international academic collaboration but also provides a unique platform to broaden my research horizons.
												I look forward to sharing the results of this productive partnership in the coming months.

								<h3> New Research on Wavelet Methods for Otolith Contour Studies accepted in Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries</h3>			
											<p> We are pleased to announce that the article titled "Choosing Wavelet Methods for Otolith Contour Studies" by Dr. Joana Vasconcelos and colleagues has been accepted for publication in the prestigious journal Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries.
												This study presents a comparative analysis of wavelet-based methods for identifying populations and phenotypes. Specifically, it contrasts the results from the shapeR package with the AFORO methodology, both widely used in fisheries science. The blue jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) was selected as the focal species for this research, offering valuable insights into its population structure.
												The findings from this study are expected to make a significant contribution to the field, providing researchers with a clearer understanding of how to select the most suitable method for otolith contour analysis. Stay tuned for the article’s release to uncover the full details and implications of this innovative research!
